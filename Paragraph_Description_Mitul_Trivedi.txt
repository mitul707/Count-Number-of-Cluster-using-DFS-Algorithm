I have created one program to understand 'DFS Algorithm' by traversing the nodes with recursion.
The program finds the total number of components from the given string array.

For example given string array can be as below,
	 0123
	 ||||
0---->	"1100",
1---->	"1110",
2---->	"0110",
3---->	"0001"

1 -> There's an adjacency node
0 -> There's no adjacency.

0, 1, 2, 3 are the numbers indicating the Nodes.

So, above string array will give me an adjacency list for the nodes as below.

0--> 0,1	[For Example: Node 0 is connected with Node 0 and Node 1]
1--> 0,1,2
2--> 1,2
3--> 3		[For Example: Node 3 is only connected with Node 3 itself]

Now, I will traverse from 0 to number of nodes with DFS to see how many nodes I will reach from 0.
That means 0, 1 and 2 will find in the same cluster. While Node 3 is not connected to any of the other nodes.

So the output for above mentioned problem will be as below:
Number of Connected Components: 2

Understanding of the doDFS function in my program:
1) I have already created adjacency List from the given array of string.
2) doDFS function basically mark the current node as visited.
3) Then with that current node I will traverse all the adjacency node and call doDFS recursively.
